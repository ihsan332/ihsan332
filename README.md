## Welcome

## 🧠 Summary 
I am a 3rd-year Software Engineering student at Ontario Tech University. Outside of the personal projects on this page, I also do work for two engineering design teams (They compete in The Pacbot Competition and the Canadian International Rover Challenge respectively). Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments about my work.
